1.DE_union_for_cluster.txt : is SOM_cluster.png and K_means_cluster.png data

Note£º

	1.sRNA£ºall different expression miRNA

	2.sample1£ºsample1's TPM

	2.sample2£ºsample2's TPM

2.Hcluster_heatmap.pdf/png : the heatmap of different expression miRNA(png).
	 red represents miRNAs with high expression level, blue represents miRNAs with low expression level. The colour from red to blue represents the log10(TPM+1) value from large to small.

4.K_means_cluster :the contents of K_means cluster analysis

result£º

	1.K_means_cluster.png : K-means cluster

	
	this figure using miRNA relative expression level log2(ratio) to cluster.
	the gray line in each figure representing a cluster of one miRNA in different samples.
	the blue line in each figure representing the mean cluster of this group miRNAs in different samples.
	the red line is reference ,line up is up regulated,line down is down regulated.
	the x axis is experiment condition,the y axis is relative expression.
