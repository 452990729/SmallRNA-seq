RNA-Seq Correlation

The biological replicates are necessary for any biological experiment including the RNA-seq technology . It has two usages, first is to demonstrate the experiment is repeatable, the other is to use in the miRNA difference expression analysis.The correlation between samples is an important evaluating indicator to test the reliability of the experiment. The more the correlation coefficient is close to 1, the higher the summarily of the samples.
