miRNA base edit

	Position 2~8 of a mature miRNA is called seed region which is highly conserved. The target of a miRNA might be different with the change of nucleotides in this region. In our analysis pipeline, miRNAs which might have base edit can be detected by aligning unannotated sRNA reads with mature miRNAs from miRBase.
