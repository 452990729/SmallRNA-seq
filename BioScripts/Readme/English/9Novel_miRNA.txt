Novel miRNA prediction

	The characteristic hairpin structure of miRNA precursor can be used to predict novel miRNA.We use miREvo and mirdeep2 to predict novel miRNA.

****************************************************************************
novel_miRNA.map.stat	The statistics of each sample's reads mapped to predicting miRNA hairpin and mature sequence.
Note£º
(1)Novel mature£ºPredicted mature.The second line is the number of all reads mapped to  mature,line(3) to line(n+2) is the number of each sample's reads align to predicted mature .
(2)Novel star£ºPredicted star sequence.The second line is the number of all reads mapped to star sequence.line(3) to line(n+2) is the number of each sample's reads  align to predicted star.
(3)Novel hairpin£ºPredicted h sequence.The second line is the number of all reads mapped to hairpin sequence.line(3) to line(n+2) is the number of each sample's reads  align to predicted hairpin.
(4)Mapped uniq sRNA£ºTotal number of reads mapped to hairpin.
(5)Mapped total sRNA£ºUnique number of reads mapped to mature.
****************************************************************************
novel_miRNA.map.fas	Total reads mapped to  hairpin predicted.
Note£º
(1)Lines starting with ">": Behind ">" is id, the first three character is sample name,next is "_",then is the id of this reads in each sample,next is also "_",at last is x and the frequency of this read.
(2)Read£ºSequencing read.
