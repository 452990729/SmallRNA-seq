Enrichment analysis of different expression miRNA targets( target gene candidates in the following)


********************************************************************************
*vs* :this file is the enrichment result of each compare group

*vs*diffmiRNAID		this is the different expression miRNA list of each compare group
*vs*diffmiRNA-geneid	this is the targets id of different expression miRNA

GOenrichment	GO enrichment result ,if one compare group no GO enrichment,then no png and pdf result
