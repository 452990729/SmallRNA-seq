miRNA differential expression


The input data was the readcount value from the miRNA expression level analysis. For the samples with biological replicates,DESeq2 was used to do the analysis: For the samples without biological replicates, TMM was first used to normalize the read count value, and the DEGseq  was used to do the analysis.

Note£º
*vs*.Differential_analysis_results.xls	all the miRNA differential expression result
DEGseq note£º
(1)First line : miRNA mature id.
(2)Second line : the readcount values of sample1 after normalized. 
(3)Third line : the readcount values of sample2 after normalized.
(4)log2.Fold_change: log2(Sample1/Sample2)¡£
(5)p.value: the p.value. 
(6)q.value.Storey.et.al..2003.: pvalue after normalized. The smaller the qvalue is, the more significant the difference is.
DESeq2 note£º
(1)sRNA: miRNA mature id.
(2)Group1£ºthe readcount values of sample1 after normalized. 
(3)Group2£ºthe readcount values of sample2 after normalized.
(4)log2FoldChange: log2FoldChange.
(5)pval: p value.
(6)padj: pvalue after normalized. The smaller the qvalue is, the more significant the difference is.
