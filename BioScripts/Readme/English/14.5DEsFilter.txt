Volcano plot could be used to infer the overall distribution of different expression miRNAs. 
For the experiment without biological replicate, the threshold is normally set as: 
|log2(FoldChange)| > 1 and qvalue < 0.01. For the experiment with biological replicate, 
as the DESeq2 has already eliminate the biological variation, our threshold is normally set as: padj < 0.05.

The x-axis is miRNAs in different samples, and the y-axis is the statically significance of the difference.
The dot representing each miRNA,blue dots indicate no significant difference miRNA,red dots indicate significant
up regulation of miRNA,green dots indicate significant difference by miRNA.
