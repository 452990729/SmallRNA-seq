[1]Data cleaning£º
	The impurities of raw data are 5' primer contaminants,no insert tags,oversized insertion,low quality reads,poly A tags and small tags.We will get rid of some contaminant reads from the fq file and get the final clean reads.
	The data is processed by the following steps£º
	(1) Getting rid of reads with sQ <= 5 base percentage > 50% .
	(2) Getting rid of reads containing N > 10%.
	(3) Getting rid of reads with 5' primer contaminants.
	(4) Getting rid of reads without 3' primer and reads without the insert tag.
	(5) trim 3'primer sequence.
	(6) Getting rid of reads with polyA/T/G/C.
